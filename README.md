# Cybersecurity Threat Landscape (Part 2 - Akamai)

DDOS attack events from January 2019 to September 2019 largely targeted which industry? It was the gaming industry. 

Almost 50% of unique targets for DDoS attacks from January 2019 - September 2019 largely targeted which industry? It was the financial services industry.

Which companies are the top phishing targets, according to Akamai? 

Microsoft, PayPal, DHL, Dropbox, DocuSign, and LinkedIn are all top phishing targets, according to Akamai’s monitoring.

What is credential stuffing? Credential stuffing is a cyber attack in which credentials obtained from a data breach on one service are used to attempt to log in to another unrelated service. Credential stuffing is widespread due to massive lists of breached credentials being traded and sold on the black market. Credential stuffing tools that use bots to get around traditional login protections, have made credential stuffing a popular attack vector.

Which country is the number one source of credential abuse attacks? Which country is number 2? America is the number one source of credential abuse attacks and Russia is the second.

Which country is the number one source of web application attacks? Which country is number 2? The United States is the number one source of web application attacks and Brazil is number two.

In Akamai’s State of the Internet report, it refers to a possible DDoS team that the company thought was affecting a customer in Asia (starts on page 11). 

Describe what was happening: Early in 2018, Akamai noticed a customer in Asia was receiving an abnormal amount of traffic to one of its URLs. Traffic volume reached 875,000 requests per second at one point. Notes from early in the incident record the flood of traffic as highly distributed, with early log grabs recording 5.5 Gbps.

What did the team believe the source of the attack was? The SOCC started digging into the report and saw a large amount of HTTP requests going to a customer’s URL from multiple IP addresses — leading to an immediate presumption of a DDoS attack. At the time, there simply wasn’t any other way to explain the sudden unexpected flood of traffic.

What did the team actually discover? Earlier analysis, backed by additional SIRT research, concluded the high volume of traffic hammering this customer’s URL was the result of a warranty tool gone haywire. 

What is an example of a performance issue with bot traffic? Bot traffic can create a severe load on your site's servers, slowing down server-side response times. This results in delays for your end users, most notably in the geographic regions where an influx of bot traffic is present.

Known-good bots are bots that perform useful or helpful tasks, and not do anything malicious to sites or servers. What are the main categories of known-good bots. 
1. SEARCH ENGINE CRAWLERS, 2. WEB ARCHIVES, 3. SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION, AUDIENCE ANALYTICS, AND MARKETING SERVICES, 4. SITE MONITORING SERVICES, 5. CONTENT AGGREGATORS.

What are two evasion techniques that malicious bots use? The most basic evasion technique is changing the User Agent, or other HTTP header values, allowing the bot to impersonate widely used browsers, mobile applications, or even known-good bots. Bots will also change the IP addresses used in order to mask their origin, or use multiple IP addresses to bypass rate limitations.
